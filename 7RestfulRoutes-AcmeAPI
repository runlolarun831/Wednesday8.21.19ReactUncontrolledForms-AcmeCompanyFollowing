Restful Routes
Look at routes and figure out what is in it...uses descritive words for dat, usually easy to figure out what is in Endpoint


RESTful routes use verbs and show how to structure our routes
ex)
  Endpoint /users/:id/companyProfits
                  ^^^ we give it the company id to find the particular company's profits

----GET----
get requests are used for reading data
we have used GET in get requests in Axios
We have mostly used Get requests

*****Other ways to call routes thend to be destructive*****
----POST----
post is the verb we use to create data
looking at POST ex. below
all the requests over this route are going across the server, this is some sort of request, HTTP request, that goes over the wire, it not only describes URL of where you are going to, but also give some info about the verb(POST)
if route exists
this allows the API to look at the PAYLOAD which allows a user to follow company and pass companyID, rating, and userId ---this allows user to follow company

----PUT----
allows user to update what they are following

PUT /api/users/:userId/followingCompanies/:followingId
               ^^^^^^^                     ^^^^^^^^^^^
               user                         the id of what they are following

----DELETE----

DELETE /api/users/:userId/followingCompanies/:followingId
                  ^^^^^^^                     ^^^^^^^^^^^
                  user                         the id of what they are deleting

returns nothing
